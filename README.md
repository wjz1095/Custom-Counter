A custom counter program for Windows, built in VB.net

Now with the ability to export to a CSV file.

Code is open source and may be modified or used in other projects, provided you cite my project as a source or inspiration of your project.

Future plans are to be able to add and remove counters dynamically instead of having the fixed amount on startup. However, I don't know how to do that yet so 12 it is for the time being
